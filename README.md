# Deep_Learning-Birds-Classification
Image classification model using "Inception-ResNet-v2 " with Transfer learning technique and some additional CNN layers. This model able to classify the bird among 225 species with 92% accuracy.

## Dataset:
Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species
Recently the data set hase been updated to 250 bird species. Thet have added 25 more species for the previous dataset.
Update the dataset link in notebook(at kaggle download command) for successful execution.


## NOTE:
Model.h5 file was not added here, since the file size is large. Train the model using ipynb file, model.h5 file will be saved. Use that file for deployment.
